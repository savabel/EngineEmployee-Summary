## Challenges
I got very late in completing my Homework these past weeks.
Several issues arose on my end and I had a little quality time to get these homework correctly completed.
Rendering the final HTML file took me a lot of time to correctly ( I hope) get right.
I did not run the required tests as I was running out of time to complete this.

### How to use the application ?
In the terminal windows : RUN "node index.js"
